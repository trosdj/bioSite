                <h3>Knitting</h3>
                <p>
                    Violet spends a lot of her time knitting gifts for her family. Not one 
                    Trost will ever go with a cold head, or chilly hands, if she has anything
                    to do with it. She enjoys both the feeling of finishing a project and how
                    calming it can be. As Violet believes everyone can learn how to knit, 
                    click this card to learn how to knit from an online tutorial.

                    Family is the most important thing to Violet. As the matriarch of the Trost
                    family, she takes pride in the accomplishments of her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.

                <p>
                    It was more than just a job for Violet. Taking care of her little town was
                    something she was very happy to do. Across her long career, she made strides
                    in making the Village of Vernon a bit of rural paradise. Click this card to
